# Hash Table
We will be creating a hash table.
## Challenge
The challenge entails creating a hash table that implements the add, get, contains and hash methods.
## Approach & Efficiency
* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table.
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
