# FizzBuzz
We will be creating a FizzBuzz tree
## Challenge
The challenge entails creating a binary tree and replacing its value with fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz
## Approach & Efficiency
Created a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument. determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.
